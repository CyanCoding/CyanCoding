## CyanCoding aka Camden Mac Leod
Hey there! 👋


### About me:
`cout << "Hello world!"`

I'm CyanCoding aka Camden Mac Leod!

I'm a hobbyist teen coder with 6 years of experience in over 20 different languages. I mostly build small projects, but I am expanding and learning new systems like Xamarin, QT, and UWP. I like to code on Windows 10 in C# and C++. I also sometimes use Ubuntu Linux. Currently I'm running Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS on my main PC.

I hope to get a major in CPU engineering and Business and work at Microsoft. 👨‍💻

I am pretty new to GitHub because I didn't understand it or have a use for it until about a year ago. I am going to use it a lot more over the next few years to stay organized and collaborate!<br><br>
