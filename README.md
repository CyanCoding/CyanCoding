## CyanCoding aka Camden Mac Leod
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

`Console.Write("Hello World!")`


### About me:

My name is Camden Mac Leod, but I write code under CyanCoding - a fun nickname I came up with my friend a few years back. I've been coding since I was 11 (that's 6.5 years). I've coded in over 25 different languages, but my favorites are C#, C++, and Go.<br>

- C# (since 2018) - my favorite language of all time, mostly because it's easy to read, runs and builds very well, and has pretty much everything I need.
- C++ (since 2018) - I'm pretty good with C++ but it's overly complicated for many of my purposes so I usually sacrifice the speed for a simpler language like C#.
- Go (since 2021) - My second favorite language! I love how modern it is and it's easy enough to code in, but the performance is horrifying.

I also like Kotlin, but I don't have much use for it and the JVM isn't my favorite.
